<div class= "container">
    <p>Schools across the country have been struggling to retain students since the pandemic started, including New York City public schools. A student is considered chronically absent if they have missed at least 18 school days, which is 10% of the school year. The percentage of chronically absent students was around 25% before the pandemic and has since reached between 30-40%. While some aspects of our lives have "returned to normal" since 2020, this increase indicates that some issues in public education have remained.</p>
    <!-- EXPERT QUOTE -->
    <p>Members of Community Education Council District 5, whose school district had the highest number of chronically absent students last year at 58%, did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
